## Marcus Aurelius

> Waste no more time arguing what a good person should be . Be One.

> Think of the life you have lved in until now as over and, as a dead man, see what's left as a bonus and live it according to Nature. Love the hand that fate deals you and play it as your own, for what could be more fitting?

> It never ceases to amaze me: we all love ourselves more than other people, but care more about their opinion than our own.

> In you actions, don't procrastinate. In you conversations, don't confuse. In you thoughts, don't wander. In you sould, do't be passive or aggresive. In you life, don't be all about business.

> If it is not right, do not do it, if it is not true, do not say it.


## Seneca

> He who fears death will never do anything worth of a man who is alive.

> Life is very short and anxious for those who forget the past, neglect the present, and fear the future
